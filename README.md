# How is it linked to research ideas

Our Research ideas, as we near the end of the master, both center around the methods and technologies in world building, virtual realities and using the augmented reality as a tool for speculation. In the case of Nikita, he centers his final project around narrative building, storytelling in the form of 3D visualizations. Photogrammetry and point clouds For Busi, simulation of living objects for awareness and education especially in the instance of forestation using VR and XR as tools



# Concept of the project (What questions need to be answered)

The concept of the project was using point cloud photogrammetry, Unity and VR tools to create a visual essay. The concept of the story is a an experience of a traveler in a dream, finding themselves and the meaning of Metamorphosis. The question we wanted to answer, was how can we merge the worlds of storytelling and symbolism and VR. We aimed to intertwined symbolism and realism through imaginative realities that virtual reality offers.


Additionally to our concept, we wanted to disseminate the values and ideologies of the father of VR, Jaron Lanier. Inspired by the idea of haptic intelligence- the idea that virtual reality is not just visiting a world, but becoming one with it.



# Propose(What is it supposed to do or not do )

What is it supposed to do:
Creation of a VR 360 movie where the viewer has 360 degrees of freedom to experience the environment
Explore unity as a Interface application maker for making VR 360 environment
Output a video that can be uploaded on a web platform
 
# Team Plan
[Busi] Unity dev: 
- Point cloud visualizer setup and PLY models imports.
- Creating the world by placing the objects within the proposed story line.
- Camera setup and testing with a prototype (zombie movie). Including camera movement in Unity, rendering the image sequence, compilig the video on Adobe Premiere and uploadinng to Youtube 360. 

[Nikita] Point Cloud capoture with Agisoft:
- Setting up the scenes and different objects to capture with a digital camera. 
- Experimenting with different photo settings to achive the best processing results (time is a very sensitive variable) inn Agisoft. 
- Importing different 3d OBJ models fom marketplace and using CloudCompare to transform them into poinnt cloud PLYs.
- Using Blender's point cloud visualizer to clean point cloud models. 

[Nikita] Script writing: 
- Writing narration for the proposed storyline. 

# System diagram ( Functions, Parts and relations)

# Honest Design (Use of Technology)
At first we wanted to deploy a VR web app, yet in the context of time we decided to make a video uploaded to Youtube
Troubleshooting:
Figuring out how to change mesh objects into pointclouds
Figuring out how to change the VR Video we recorded in Unity , into a Image sequence through Premiere Pro
Rotational offset for the camera. - had to add c# script to the camera for a rotational movement.

# Find solutions with what you have- Be creative
Final Micro Challenge documentation 31.05.2022

I fist set up the VR environment on Unity, also brainstorming possible platforms to use
The project calls for a space that imagines the connection between digital and physical. Some endangered trees endemic to Barcelona are reimagined into peculiar spaces that have exist currently yet 

The project is a speculative exercise to imagine a space with trees that are currently endangered or extinct. The this virtual library is a prototype of an on going project that aims to make digital twins for on-going reforestation initiatives based in Guanabara bay, Brazil

The first step was to install a photogrammetry viewer, point cloud, which I downloaded from a github account. Find the link here.

After that Checked if two models can be put in together, which they could. After that I followed some videos how to use XR set up, according to this video in this link. On 1st June, I set up to link unity to a pair of VR headsets, build the terrain for the scene, and scan trees. 



After figuring out the concept, we went to take pictures of someobjects we want as photogrammetry files ( 3d point cloud objects) The sequence of making a 3D objects from photos included:
Taking pictures of an object preferably in a domelike extent, with overlapping photos that
Upload it to the IAAC cloud, use Agriform to stitch the pictures into a 3D object. For the first tries we used low quality. 

After lots of trouble shooting, we 
# Future development Opportunities

# Long Term Dissemination Plan


Collectively, our VR experience could be split into further other prototypes to better the experience. 

- Animations of talking
- Better the environment and project package,perhaps consult a game designer for resolve
- Deploy a interaction as a web application, that can be accessed outside of Youtube.
- Detail and guide the process of coding  the VR exporting, 3D modules, scripts and environments to make the project open source for educational purposes.
 - After prototyping and following the development process above, we could further develop the project by entering VR festivals, collaborating with stakeholders to - stretch the project further, gianing maturity.

For the future of Nikita´s explorations, he plans to write and make a film to be attended during the MDEFest. The title being ¨Ünspoken¨. "Unspoken" is a short VR film exploring the world where beings express themselves through mental visions, similar to how the dream world is a composition of symbols. The prospects of this could be using it in film festivals, celebrating how technologies can be used to understand the intangible.

For Busi, the longevity of the project would be more exhibitions, using Unity in collaboration with other actors. Using the dissemination steps listed above, further individual projects would center around reforestation awareness, and critical value making, such as digital twins that can be experienced using VR, for the awareness  of  future reforestation efforts
